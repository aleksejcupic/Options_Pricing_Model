Implementation of American Style Options Pricing Model using Least Squares Monte Carlo Simulation Algorithm

Abstract: An implementation of the American style Option Pricing Model
using the Least Squares Method for Monte Carlo Simulation from 
Longstaff, Schwartz, Valuing American Options by Simulation (2001)

The method is defined in their research. We implement it in Python
