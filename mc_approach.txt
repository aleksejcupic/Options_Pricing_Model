Monte Carlo Approach steps:
1.	Simulate sample paths of underlying asset prices (and interest rates) over the relevant time horizon (simulate according to risk-neutral measure)
2.	Evaluate discounted cash flows of a security on each sample path (as determined by structure of the security in question)
3.	Avg. discounted cash flows over sample paths 

Iteration of a 2 step procedure:
1.	Backward induction:
a.	Value is recursively assigned to every state at each timestep
b.	Defined as least squares regression against market price of the option value at that state and time (-step)
c.	Defined as value of exercise possibilities (dependent on market price + value of timestep which that exercise would result in (defined in previous step)
2.	Value of option is calculated by moving through the timesteps and states by making an optimal decision on option exercise at every step (multiple price paths)
