1. learn about options and LSM
    longstaff, schwartz chapter 2 is about the valuation algorithm
2. figure out what parameters we need
3. algorithm:
    iteration of 2 step procedure:
    1. backward induction:
        value is recursively assigned to every state at each timestep
        value is defined as least squares regression against market price
        of the option value at that state and time ( - step) 
        option value for the regresssion is defined as the value of 
        exercise possibilities (dependent on market price) plus the value of
        the timestamp value which that exercise would result in (defined in
        previous step of the process)
    2. when all states are valued for every timestep, value of the option is
        calculated by moving through the timesteps and states by making an optimal
        decision on option exercise at every step on the hand of the price path
        and the value of the state that would result in
        can be done with multiple price paths to add a stochastic effect to the procedure
    blocks to algorithm:
        # unsure about this
        a. basis functions
        b. brownian motion?
        c. regression?
4. figure out how to set up python functions and files
5. code it
6. running tests for sample data
7. plots using matplotlib
8. possibly use other methods to compare
9. make presentation
